## Introduction

This application provides a completely free alternative to services like WAVA AI, allowing you to:

*   Generate high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) voiceovers using various AI models.
*   Create engaging videos by combining scripts, AI voices, background footage, and music.
*   Clone voices for personalized narration (requires suitable audio samples).
*   Manage your projects and saved voices through a user-friendly dashboard.

All features are provided without limitations or subscription fees.

## Getting Started

Navigate the application using the main menu:

*   **Home:** Overview and quick links.
*   **Voice Generator:** Access the Text-to-Speech features.
*   **Video Creator:** Create AI-narrated videos.
*   **Dashboard:** View recent projects, saved voices, and usage.

## Voice Generator (TTS)

Access this section via the "Voice Generator" menu item.

### Generating Voiceovers

1.  **Enter Text:** Type or paste the script you want to convert into speech in the main text area.
2.  **Select Voice:** Choose a voice from the dropdown menu. Voices are grouped by the AI engine (e.g., Coqui, Bark).
3.  **Adjust Speed & Pitch (Optional):** Use the sliders to modify the speed and pitch of the generated voice.
4.  **Generate:** Click the "Generate Voice" button. The process may take a few moments.

### Voice Options

The application uses multiple open-source TTS engines. Each engine offers different voices with unique characteristics. Experiment to find the best voice for your needs.

### Preview & Download

*   Once generation is complete, an audio player will appear.
*   Click the play button in the player or the "Preview" button to listen.
*   Click the "Download" button to save the generated audio file (usually MP3).

### Voice Cloning (Advanced)

*   *(Note: This feature requires backend setup and a capable TTS engine like Coqui XTTS)*
*   If available, an option to upload an audio sample (e.g., a clear recording of someone speaking) will appear.
*   Upload the file and provide a name for the cloned voice.
*   The system will process the audio to create a new voice option that mimics the speaker.

## Video Creator

*   The process will combine these videos side-by-side with the AI narration.

## Dashboard

## Troubleshooting

*   **Generation Fails:** Ensure you have entered text and selected a voice/background. Check the error message displayed. Complex or very long requests might fail, especially on free hosting tiers with time limits.
*   **Options Not Loading:** If voices, backgrounds, or music options don't appear, try refreshing the page. If the problem persists, the backend service might be unavailable.
*   **Slow Generation:** Video and complex voice generation can take time. Please be patient.
